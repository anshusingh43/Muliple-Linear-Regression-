# Muliple-Linear-Regression-

Multi Linear Regression or MLR is the predictive analysis modelling which is used to describe the data and explain the relationship between 
one dependent variable and two or more than two independent variables. MLR helps to understand how much will the dependent variable change when we change the independent variable or in other words it shows the dependencies of the dependent and independent variables.

We have the "Votes" data set which records property of 732 County level results for percent voting for Bill Clinton in 1992 Presidential Election and Demographical Variables. For the description of the data, we have Votes dataset. Main task is to check if the vote percentage is dependent on the geographics data.

In this, VOTES is the dependent variable. We are keeping the first 500 records as a training set called as VOTETRAIN which will be used to fit the model and 232 will be used as a test set VOTETEST.
